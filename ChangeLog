	revision, to avoid gconjugue running in English in some circumstances.

	brazilian-conjugate.

	coagir, interagir, enviuvar, abaular, estrear, intermediar, mobiliar,
	faiscar, esmiuçar, apaziguar, averiguar, obliquar, adequar, comprazer,
	moer, remoer, roer, corroer, entupir, desentupir, inquerir, suster,

2006-07-09 GCONJUGUE-0.6 released

	* callbacks.c: The verb is converted into lower case before being
	conjugated.

	* main.c: If gconjugue receives a parameters at startup, it will try
	to conjugate the first parameter, unless this parameter is "-h",
	"--help", "-v", or "--version".

	* all source files: The messages in the source code are now in English
	and the use of gettext was activated.

	* glade files: Eliminated from source code. The Glade Interface
	Builder was useful to start the project but now I'll maintain the code
	without it.

2006-01-08 GCONJUGUE-0.4 released

	* callbacks.c: Gconjugue was confused if there was either a space
	before the word or more than one word in the GtkEntry. The program
	would also either freeze or not work properly if the symbols &, ", ',
	|, >, <, $ were included in the string as part of the verb. These bugs
	were fixed.

	* callbacks.c: Colorized text. No longer using temporary files: now
	connecting with conjugue through a pipe. When conjugating the verb, the
	GtkEntry text is automatically selected to make it easier to type a
	new text.

	* main.c: Added the creation of GtkTextBuffer tags: bold, red, blue,
	and large.

2005-12-28 GCONJUGUE-0.2 released

	* callbacks.c: Fixed bug in GError usage.

	* callbacks.c: Fixed bug when the user locale isn't iso-8859-1. The bug
	was discovered by Luiz Carcerelli.
	
	* *.png: Red letter "V" replaced with an yellow one (green background).

	* callbacks.c: Pressing <Enter> in the GtkEntry has the same effect of
	  clicking in the button "conjugar" (suggestion made by Cárlisson
	  Galdino).
